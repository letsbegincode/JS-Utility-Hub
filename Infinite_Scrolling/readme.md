# Infinite Scrolling Utilities

## Overview
This folder contains three implementations of Infinite Scrolling:
1. **By Simple `await` Approach**
2. **By Generator Function**
3. **With Intersection Observer**

Each approach is designed to dynamically load data as the user scrolls, making it efficient for large datasets.

## Usage Examples

### By Simple `await` Approach
```javascript
setupInfiniteScroll('content', 'https://example.com/api/data');
```

### By Generator Function
```javascript
setupInfiniteScrollWithGenerator('content', 'https://example.com/api/data');
```

### With Intersection Observer
```javascript
setupInfiniteScrollWithObserver('content', 'https://example.com/api/data');
```

## Features
- Dynamically loads content as the user scrolls.
- Prevents redundant API calls with optimized event handling.
- Supports modern browser APIs for enhanced performance.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for error retries.
- Optimize for virtualization with placeholders.
